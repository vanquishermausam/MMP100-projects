	<p>Staten Island is the southernmost of New York City's 5 boroughs. It is connected to Lower Manhattan via the Staten Island Ferry, which runs across New York Harbor. Staten Island Zoo is home to kangaroos, birds of prey and snakes. The Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden features flower beds, Greek revival buildings and art galleries. Its grounds also include the Staten Island Childrenâ€™s Museum.</p>

<p>Easily accessible by a scenic ride on the Staten Island Ferry, the greenest borough feels like a getaway within the City. Beyond a charming North Shore rich with maritime history, Staten Island is best known for its beaches, vast parkland and even a fully preserved colonial village.</p>
